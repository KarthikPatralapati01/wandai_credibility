======================
üìå NEW CLAIMS ADDED
======================
1. "NHTSA also reported that Tesla vehicles had a higher rate of Autopilot-related collisions per million miles compared to other manufacturers‚Äô advanced driver-assistance systems."
   Score: 0.647 (MEDIUM)
   Reason: This new claim introduces a verified metric comparing Tesla's Autopilot collision rates to competitors, providing an independent benchmark for assessing the safety of advanced driver-assistance systems.

============================
‚ôªÔ∏è UPDATED EXISTING CLAIMS
============================
"However, the IIHS also warned that Tesla‚Äôs driver assistance features can encourage overreliance, leading to driver distraction in some cases."
Old: 0.404 ‚Üí New: 0.465  ‚ñ≤ Increased
Reason: The increase in credibility is due to moderate-credibility evidence from NHTSA indicating that Tesla's Autopilot-related collision rate is higher than that of competitors, highlighting potential safety concerns associated with overreliance on its driver assistance features.

==============================
üß† LLM SUMMARY OF IMPACT
==============================
The new claim from NHTSA contradicts prior claims by suggesting Tesla's Autopilot-related collision rate is higher than competitors, thereby challenging the perception of its safety compared to other systems.
