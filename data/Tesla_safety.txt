According to a 2024 safety evaluation by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the Tesla Model Y earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating. The report noted that Tesla’s automatic emergency braking system performed exceptionally well in real-world scenarios. However, the IIHS also warned that Tesla’s driver assistance features can encourage overreliance, leading to driver distraction in some cases. The study concluded that while Tesla vehicles offer strong crash protection, their automated systems still require careful monitoring and improvement.
